# MLJSON - JSON parsing, serialization, construction and more

The MLJSON project is a set of libraries for working with JSON content.

Note: This project used to contain a REST frontend to expose MarkLogic
functionality.  That work has now been split off into a new project,
[Corona](https://github.com/marklogic/Corona).
